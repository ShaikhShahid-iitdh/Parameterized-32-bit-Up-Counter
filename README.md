EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the complete ASIC design flow for a 32-bit parameterized up counter, from initial RTL specification through final tapeout. The design successfully completed all 8 stages of the modern ASIC development process, achieving excellent performance metrics with zero violations.

Key Achievements:
- ✓ Achieved 121.27 MHz operation (21.3% above 100 MHz target)
- ✓ Ultra-low power: 239.88 µW @ 100 MHz
- ✓ Compact die: 75×75 µm (5625 µm² total area)
- ✓ Zero violations across all verification stages
- ✓ 100% timing closure at all PVT corners
- ✓ Manufacturing-ready GDSII
